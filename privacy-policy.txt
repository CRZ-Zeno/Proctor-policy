Effective Date: October 8th, 2025.

Proctor and its companion extension Web Gatekeeper do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data outside the user’s device.

All operational data, including status checks, integrity logs, and incognito access states, is stored locally using Chrome’s storage.local API.

The extensions do not connect to any external servers, and no information is shared with third parties.

Permissions such as idle, storage, as well as isAllowedIncognitoAccess and onMessageExternal are used strictly for:
– monitoring the operational status of Web Gatekeeper;
– detecting incognito access changes for system integrity;
– and maintaining local synchronization between both extensions.

By installing this extension, you acknowledge that no personal information leaves your browser, and all processing remains within your local Chrome environment.
