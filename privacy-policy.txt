Effective Date: October 17th, 2025

Proctor and its companion extension, Web Gatekeeper, do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data outside the user’s device.

All information — including integrity logs, status checks, and incognito access states — is stored locally using Chrome’s storage.local API.

The extensions do not connect to any external servers, and no data is shared with third parties.

Permissions such as management and storage are used strictly for the following purposes:
management: monitoring and verifying the operational status of Web Gatekeeper to detect disable, uninstall, or tampering events;
storage: saving system integrity data and local synchronization states between both extensions;

By installing this extension, you acknowledge that no personal information leaves your browser.
